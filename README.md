# Ajitem's Brewfile

A brewfile allows us to easily install multiple brew packages.

## Install Brew

If you don't already have Homebrew installed, use the following command to install it:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Installing the Packages

1. Clone the repository.
2. Edit the Brewfile to add/remove the packages according to your preferences.
3. Run `brew bundle` in the same directory as the Brewfile.
